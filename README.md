## ðŸ“„ About the Project

Out of respect for my grandparents who have passed away, I chose to dedicate the site to my dog.
## ðŸ§± Page Structure

The website is composed of several sections:
- **About Me:** A text block about my dog. This section includes a scroll bar when needed, ensuring content stays inside its designated area even on smaller screens or with increased zoom.
- **My Photos:** A horizontal, auto-scrolling photo gallery featuring images of my dog.
- **My Playlist:** A section embedding dog-related music videos.
- **Like & QR Code:** Both the Facebook Like button and a QR code are grouped in a single section for UI cleanliness, while still maintaining separate buttons for user interaction.
- **SPA Q&A & Contact:** Additional content for user engagement and a contact form.

The layout is designed to be responsive, supporting both desktop and mobile views.
